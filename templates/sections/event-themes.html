        Last year's edition was about the need for frontend engineers to exchange skills with designers, as well as automating frontend workflows. The emphasis was on making web engineering a two-way interaction between designers and engineers, and getting them out of their comfort zones.

        For 2015 our focus is on (a) Design from a web engineering standpoint, and (b) Enhancing the state of web experiences on mobile devices, with their many constraints. Proposals are open; do head along to our <a href="https://metarefresh.talkfunnel.com/2015/">funnel</a> to propose a talk!
